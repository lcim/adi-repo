# Mazi Chiadi MBIBI

## Intro

I live in PortHarcourt City, in Rivers State of Nigerian.

### Reading
Three of my favourite books are:

 - *Animal farm* by George Orwell
 - *The Concubine* by Elechi Amadi
 - * Things Fall Apart* by Chinua Achebe

### Food
 Nwanne, dreaming about food is unacceptable; spirits don't eat. Some of the nice places i have eaten or would love to eat out at are:

1. Del Amore restaurant, PortHarcourt, Nigeria. Their Isiewu makes sense.
2. Ebeanunchi na ugba, in Lome, Togo
3. Shawarma zone, in Houston, The US
